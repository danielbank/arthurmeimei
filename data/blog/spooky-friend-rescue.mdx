# My First Hackathon: How We Made a Spooky Game!

Guess what? My dad took me and Arthur to a real AI coding hackathon! It was hosted by a cool guy named Mat Sherman. Dad said there weren't any rules about kids not being allowed, so we got to go too!

## Our Awesome Ghost Game

We made this super cool game called [Spooky Friend Rescue](https://spooky-friend-rescue.lovable.app/). In the game, your friend gets captured by ghosts in a haunted house, and you have to save them! You walk around the spooky house looking for items, and when ghosts pop up, you have to answer math problems and riddles to defeat them. It's kind of like homework, but WAY more fun because you're fighting ghosts!

We built most of our game in just ONE HOUR during the hackathon! Can you believe that? Later, we added some cool AI art for the backgrounds and fixed a few bugs, but we did the main stuff right there at the event. We used something called Lovable, which made it easier to build our ideas.

## The Grown-Ups Were Impressed!

The hackathon host (that's Mat) said our game was "pretty well done" and that it was "impressive" we built it with Lovable. He even shared it with other people to play!

## You Can Play Our Game!

I never thought I could make a real computer game, but now I know kids can make cool stuff too! Maybe we'll make another game soon. What kind of game would you make?
