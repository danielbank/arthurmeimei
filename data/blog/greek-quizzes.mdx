# Greek Mythology Quizzes

We watched two of the [Ray Harryhausen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Harryhausen) films about Greek myths: [Clash of the Titans](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clash_of_the_Titans_(1981_film)>), [Jason and the Argonauts](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jason_and_the_Argonauts_(1963_film)>). In order to watch each film, we had to pass a quiz.
